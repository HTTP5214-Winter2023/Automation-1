# Automation-1

Topic name: Automated test case generator

Pain point: Hard to remember sytax. for testing code to make it effective and reduce timeframe. if we don't have to write a sytax for testing code.

Solution: Some Question for user
Field 1) How many test case user want
field 2) Which type test case user want to do. Example: test to pass, test to fail, boundary test, end to end test.
 Features:
 when user had fill 2 filed they will get a sytax for test.
 after that user also have option to +; if they want to add another test and again Field 1) , field 2) appear.
