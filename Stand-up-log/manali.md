<h3>Date: 01-02-2023<h3>
<h4>Work Topic: Automated test case generator</h4>

I first researched the pain point and identified hard to remember syntax every time. I then started working on which topic we can select to make human life easy. We end-up with automated testing code generator to make it effective and reduce timeframe, if user don’t have to write syntax for testing code.

Next, we head for rough solution steps; what we need to make this website successful. We decided to make it like form. Like,
Field 1) How many tests case user want
field 2) Which type test case user want to do. Example: test to pass, test to fail, boundary test, end to end test.

We want to have one feature where user can add another case, user also have option to ‘+’ sign; if they want to add another test and again Field 1), field 2) appear.

<h4>Meeting: 2 Madiha Umair, Work Topic: Finalize language to work on rough wireframe<h4>
 
 
I first research on what technology we need to make it effective and quick responsive website as user rush. As everyone agree with frontend with html/css, backend with php and mySQL. We decided to work with visual studio code software.
Next, we start to ask question to our self what information we need from user and we start to create rough wireframe. As below,
