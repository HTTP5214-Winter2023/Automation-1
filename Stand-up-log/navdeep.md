Automation Group: 1 Topic name: Automated test case generator Pain point: Hard to remember syntax. for testing code to make it effective and reduce timeframe. if we don't have to write a syntax for testing code. Solution: Some Question for user Field 1) How many test case user want field 2) Which type test case user want to do. Example: test to pass, test to fail, boundary test, end to end test. Features: when user had fill 2 filed, they will get a syntax for test. after that user also have option to +; if they want to add another test and again Field 1) , field 2) appear.

Some design adds in CSS.
Teams decided to change language instead PHP/SQL to JavaScript.
