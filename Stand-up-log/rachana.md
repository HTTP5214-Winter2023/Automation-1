We first researched the pain point and identified hard to remember syntax every time. Then we started working on which topic we can select to make human life easy. We end-up with automated testing code generator to make it effective and reduce timeframe, if user don’t have to write syntax for testing code.

Next, we head for rough solution steps; what we need to make this website successful. We decided to make it like form. Like,
Field 1) How many tests case user want
field 2) Which type test case user want to do. Example: test to pass, test to fail, boundary test, end to end test.

We want to have one feature where user can add another case, user also have option to ‘+’ sign; if they want to add another test and again Field 1), field 2) appear.

<h4>Meeting: 2 Madiha Umair, Work Topic: Finalize language to work on rough wireframe</h4>
 
 
I first research on what technology we need to make it effective and quick responsive website as user rush. As everyone agree with frontend with html/css, backend with php and mySQL. We decided to work with visual studio code software.
Next, we start to ask question to our self what information we need from user and we start to create rough wireframe. As below,

Research all the posible validation for give fields. Start coding in class but end with no any validation working. Even unable to find why button is not working. During Debugging we found missing span tag in HTML so add span tag for showing error message.
Discuss about how we will generate test case after form validation done. Found one repository only where we can generate test with regx pattern with randexp.js file. This week class done without solve button issue and idea of test case generate loop.

<h3>Date: 28-03-2023</h3>
Me and Madiha having some time today evening so we decide to debug as we are little back for testing
 
Try to debugging and create a validation for each of the field as per regx pattern use. Finally found button issue; Button is out side of the form thats the reason it not working. so Clean up work and finish code in well manner. 

Completed entire form validation and Had user testing with developer friend(Working as a backend developer).
 
Result of User Testing: All the fields are quick easy to use except of Regx pattern one so as per their suggestion no any developer remind regx pattern button they can google and found but that only suggestion we got during user testing.
