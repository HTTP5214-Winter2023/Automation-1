Work Topic: Automated test case generator
I first researched the pain point and identified hard to remember syntax every time. I then started working on which topic we can select to make human life easy. 
We end-up with automated testing code generator to make it effective and reduce timeframe, if user don’t have to write syntax for testing code.

Next, we head for rough solution steps; what we need to make this website successful. We decided to make it like form. 
Like, Field 1) How many tests case user want field 2) Which type test case user want to do. Example: test to pass, test to fail, boundary test, end to end test.

We want to have one feature where user can add another case, user also have option to ‘+’ sign; if they want to add another test and again Field 1), field 2) appear.

I first research on what technology we need to make it effective and quick responsive website as user rush. As everyone agree with frontend with html/css, backend 
with php and mySQL. We decided to work with visual studio code software. Next, we start to ask question to our self what information we need from user and we 
start to create rough wireframe. 
As below, Header, Nav menu, footer Introduction for our website: We are doing client side validation!

Also, I looked for how to put things on website. Plus, how it will look too. I was looking for solutions of these questions.

So, decided to put these questions on web page:

Q1:Select a field to generate a test case:

Q2:Spec for humberID

Q3: How many cases user want and what test they want to create?

We start with figma design. After completing design. After that we divide responsibility Fontend: Rachana, Disa, Jaclyn Backend: Manali, Madiha,
Navdeep, Me(Udip). We create road map for our self; so to start we need HTML form to work on. next we will validate form with vanilla javascript 
and had a user testing with it. as per user testing we will implementing correction in it. and then will create a function which will generate test case as regarding user input.

Meeting:6  Work topic: Research on Function which generate test case and solving Error
Research all the posible validation for give fields. Start coding in class but end with no any validation working. Even unable to find why button is not working.
During Debugging we found missing span tag in HTML so add span tag for showing error message. Discuss about how we will generate test case after form validation done. 
Found one repository only where we can generate test with regx pattern with randexp.js file. This week class done without solve button issue and idea of test case generate loop.



Result of User Testing: All the fields are quick easy to use except of Regx pattern one so as per their suggestion no any developer remind regx pattern button they can google and found but that only suggestion we got during user testing.
